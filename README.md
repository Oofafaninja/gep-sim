# gep-simulator

Utility service to simulate game events and info updates.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Install all the dependent npm packages locally to the current directory:

`> npm install`

Increase the minor version of the app and build it (create a local directory named "dist" that is ready to load it as an unpacked Overwolf extension)

`> gulp build`

After a successful build, a local directory named "dist" is created. You can load the app from this directory as an unpacked Overwoolf extension.

Pack the app as "ready to install" OPK package:

`> gulp opk`
